- Implemented basic back propagation while learning it from karpathy's [video](https://youtu.be/VMj-3S1tku0?si=lUwaGDpuZhPbZ29A) and [repository](https://github.com/karpathy/micrograd)
1. the learning notebook contains the code used while implementing the logic in parallel with the video.
2. the engine+nn file separates the main logic from the test cases.
3. the demo file implements a simple binary classification task using micro-grad. (in karpathy's repo too)
- The values of the training data should be objects of class Value before being passed to the model.
